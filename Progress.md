- adding readme
- paramter tuning
- trying out different solvers
  
## 25.06.2023
- added parallelism
- created overleaf project for the paper
- started adding different stopping condition

## 26.06.2023
- testing parallelism - its slow
- split optimization into two parts - fast and refining

## 27.06.2023
- further exploration of GA parameters
- enhanced the productivity of my lab members by providing a nutritious cake
- Tested the old version of the GA on Victors data
  - Uncovering a possible bug

## 28.06.2023
- Discovered a bug in the gamma fitting function provided by scipy
  - created an issue
  - temporary fix by using different fitting method
- Discovered a small bud in the myTAI flat line test
- Runned old GA on Victors data - seems promising
